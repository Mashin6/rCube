	Abstract = {Rates of mRNA synthesis and decay can be measured on a genome-wide scale in yeast by dynamic transcriptome analysis (DTA), which combines non-perturbing metabolic RNA labeling with dynamic kinetic modeling. DTA reveals that most mRNA synthesis rates are around several transcripts per cell and cell cycle, and most mRNA half-lives range around a median of 11 min. DTA realistically monitors the cellular response to osmotic stress with higher sensitivity and temporal resolution than transcriptomics, and can be used to follow changes in RNA metabolism in gene regulatory systems.},

@article{Bullard2010,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer, are powerful new tools for investigating a wide range of biological and medical questions. Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data. RESULTS: We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also reveal the need for further research in the development of statistical and computational methods for mRNA-Seq.},

@article{DePretis2015,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Cellular mRNA levels originate from the combined action of multiple regulatory processes, which can be recapitulated by the rates of pre-mRNA synthesis, pre-mRNA processing and mRNA degradation. Recent experimental and computational advances set the basis to study these intertwined levels of regulation. Nevertheless, software for the comprehensive quantification of RNA dynamics is still lacking.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: INSPEcT is an R package for the integrative analysis of RNA- and 4sU-seq data to study the dynamics of transcriptional regulation. INSPEcT provides gene-level quantification of these rates, and a modeling framework to identify which of these regulatory processes are most likely to explain the observed mRNA and pre-mRNA concentrations. Software performance is tested on a synthetic dataset, instrumental to guide the choice of the modeling parameters and the experimental design.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: INSPEcT is submitted to Bioconductor and is currently available as Supplementary Additional File S1.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: mattia.pelizzola@iit.itSupplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACTWe give an overview of experimental and computational methods to estimate RNA metabolism rates genome-wide. We then advocate a local definition of RNA metabolism rate at the level of individual phosphodiester bonds. Rates of formation and disappearance of individual bonds are unambiguously defined, in contrast to rates of complete transcripts. We show that over previous approaches, the recently developed transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq) protocol allows for estimation of metabolism rates of individual bonds with least positional bias.},

@article{Love2014a,
	Abstract = {A basic task in the analysis of count data from RNA-Seq is the detection of differentially expressed genes. The count data are presented as a table which reports, for each sample, the number of sequence fragments that have been assigned to each gene. Analogous data also arise for other assay types, including comparative ChIP-Seq, HiC, shRNA screening, mass spectrometry. An important analysis question is the quantification and statistical inference of systematic changes between conditions, as compared to within-condition variability. The package DESeq2 provides methods to test for differential expression by use of negative binomial generalized linear models; the estimates of dispersion and logarithmic fold changes incorporate data-driven prior distributions 1. This vignette explains the use of the package and demonstrates typical work flows. Another vignette, ``Beginner's guide to using the DESeq2 package'', covers similar material but at a slower pace, including the generation of count tables from FASTQ file},
